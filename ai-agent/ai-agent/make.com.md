Current AI agent building tools are not user-friendly for the average person. For instance, Autogen and CrewAI require professional installation and debugging, posing significant challenges, especially for non-software engineering professionals. In contrast, the website Make is a no-code solution that can be used directly, greatly lowering the entry barrier and enabling most people to build their own AI agents.
