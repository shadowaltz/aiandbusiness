# Perplexity

{% hint style="warning" %}
A current issue with AI search engines like Perplexity is that they search for information in the language used for the query. For instance, if you ask in English, it searches English sources; if in German, it searches German sources. This can lead to different results due to the varying richness of materials and perspectives across languages. Therefore, the same question might yield opposite conclusions depending on the language of the sources. Be mindful of this when using AI search engines.
