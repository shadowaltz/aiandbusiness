# ðŸ‘‚ Translation

Due to the outstanding performance and language capabilities of current large language models like GPT-4 and Claude Sonnet 3.5, the translation quality of these applications has already surpassed that of traditional professional translation software. Therefore, if you only need a simple translation, please directly ask the application, for example: help me translate into German:



If you want better translation results, you can use more specialized prompts to increase stability or achieve the style and tone you need, etc. For example:

> I want you to act as an English translator, spelling corrector and improver. I will speak to you in any language and you will detect the language, translate it and answer in the corrected and improved version of my text, in English. I want you to replace my simplified A0-level words and sentences with more beautiful and elegant, upper level English words and sentences. Keep the meaning same, but make them more literary. I want you to only reply the correction, the improvements and nothing else, do not write explanations. My first sentence is "istanbulu cok seviyom burada olmak cok guzel" ï¼ˆSource: Awsome ChatGPT Promptsï¼‰

If you need more accurate and reliable translation results, we can use more advanced techniques, such as training a Translation Agent. For instance, Andrew Ng's translation agent, link is as follows:

English to Japanese&#x20;

English to German

Note that content translated using this method, especially since the third step involves AI rewriting, will likely be flagged as "completely done by AI" by various AI detection software.
