Tombras, an independent advertising agency, has created what they call "The World's Smartest Billboard" for PODS, a moving and storage company. This innovative campaign, unveiled during the peak moving season in June, transformed a PODS moving container into an intelligent, dynamic billboard capable of displaying customized advertisements for each of New York's 6,000 neighborhoods. The billboard utilizes a combination of generative AI and real-time data, including location, traffic, transit, and weather information, to create hyper-localized content. This groundbreaking initiative, which was revealed at Google's annual Creative Lighthouse event during the Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity, showcases the power of AI in revolutionizing outdoor advertising and delivering highly targeted messages to potential customers.

### Case: Heinz

Heinz utilized artificial intelligence for a creative ad campaign during the early days of generative AI. By using OpenAI’s DALL-E 2, Heinz input various ketchup-themed prompts, which produced imaginative and often surreal images. Interestingly, many of these AI-generated visuals naturally incorporated Heinz’s iconic branding elements, such as its unique bottle shape and logo. This campaign demonstrated AI’s potential in marketing while reaffirming Heinz’s identity as the definitive ketchup brand, even recognized by AI.
