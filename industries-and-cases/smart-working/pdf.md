When ChatGPT was first launched, it lacked the ability to upload files, forcing users to interact by copying and pasting text from PDF documents. This cumbersome process led to the creation of API-based third-party apps, enabling direct dialogue with PDF documents, such as <mark style="background-color:orange;">ChatPDF</mark>.

With continuous upgrades to Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and Claude, these applications now support file uploads, enabling us to upload PDFs directly within the LLM chat interface to extract and summarize their content.&#x20;

Additionally, some third-party services that incorporate apps from the GPT store are introducing more sophisticated PDF interactions, such as creating a conversational knowledge base from multiple PDF documents, exemplified by solutions like <mark style="background-color:orange;">PDF Ai PDF</mark>.

In April 2024, Adobe finally introduced Generative AI features to its Adobe Acrobat and Reader software. This AI-powered conversational tool offers several key capabilities to help users work more efficiently with PDFs and documents:

1. Document summarization: AI Assistant can quickly analyze and generate concise summaries of long documents, making it easier to digest the main points.
2. Question answering: Users can ask the AI assistant questions about the content of a document, and it will provide answers with citations linking directly to the relevant sections.
3. Information formatting: The tool can extract and format information from documents, making it ready to share via email, reports, or presentations.
4. Supported file types: In addition to PDFs, AI Assistant works with other document formats like Microsoft Word and PowerPoint.
