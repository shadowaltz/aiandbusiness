## Newsï¼š

Researchers at Google DeepMind have announced a breakthrough in artificial intelligence's ability to tackle advanced mathematical challenges. The team developed a pair of specialized AI systems, called AlphaProof and AlphaGeometry 2, demonstrating remarkable proficiency in solving complex problems that demand high-level reasoning skills.

These AI systems were put to the test using questions from the International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO), a renowned competition that attracts the brightest young mathematical minds from around the globe. In an impressive display of problem-solving prowess, the AI duo successfully resolved four out of six problems from this year's IMO, an achievement equivalent to earning a silver medal in the competition.
