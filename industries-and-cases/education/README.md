### AI Competency Framework for Teachers

[https://www.unesco.org/en/articles/ai-competency-framework-teachers](https://www.unesco.org/en/articles/ai-competency-framework-teachers)

The United Nations has developed an AI and Digital Transformation Competency Framework designed to inform digital capacity-building initiatives in government[1](https://sdgs.un.org/sites/default/files/2023-05/B44%20-%20Tan%20-%20AI%20and%20Digital%20Transformation%20Competencies%20Framework.pdf). While this framework primarily focuses on civil servants, it can be adapted to create a similar competency framework for teachers, outlining the skills and knowledge educators need to integrate AI and digital technologies in their teaching practices effectively.
