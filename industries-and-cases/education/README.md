### <mark style="color:orange;">Anthropic Claude for Education</mark>

Anthropic's recent introduction of Claude for Education defies conventional expectations about AI's role in academia. Unlike typical chatbots that prioritize quick responses, this specialized platform challenges users through inquiry-driven interactions. Its signature Learning Mode employs Socratic techniques â€“ prompting learners with "What evidence supports your conclusion?" rather than supplying solutions â€“ while providing structured templates for academic writing and problem-solving. Developed through collaborations with institutions like Northeastern University and the London School of Economics, the system prioritizes skill development over answer delivery, transforming AI from a potential crutch into a catalyst for analytical growth.

### AI Competency Framework for Teachers

[https://www.unesco.org/en/articles/ai-competency-framework-teachers](https://www.unesco.org/en/articles/ai-competency-framework-teachers)

The United Nations has developed an AI and Digital Transformation Competency Framework designed to inform digital capacity-building initiatives in government[1](https://sdgs.un.org/sites/default/files/2023-05/B44%20-%20Tan%20-%20AI%20and%20Digital%20Transformation%20Competencies%20Framework.pdf). While this framework primarily focuses on civil servants, it can be adapted to create a similar competency framework for teachers, outlining the skills and knowledge educators need to integrate AI and digital technologies in their teaching practices effectively.
