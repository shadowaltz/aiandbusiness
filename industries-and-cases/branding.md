## Name & Slogan Creation&#x20;

> Generate digital startup ideas based on the wish of the people. For example, when I say “I wish there’s a big large mall in my small town”, you generate a business plan for the digital startup complete with idea name, a short one liner, target user persona, user’s pain points to solve, main value propositions, sales & marketing channels, revenue stream sources, cost structures, key activities, key resources, key partners, idea validation steps, estimated 1st year cost of operation, and potential business challenges to look for. Write the result in a markdown table. _(Source:Awsome ChatGPT Prompts)_

Utilize the "Product Naming Pro" tool from the official Anthropic Prompt Library:

**Create catchy product names from descriptions and keywords.**

**Prompt:**

> Your task is to generate creative, memorable, and marketable product names based on the provided description and keywords. The product names should be concise (2-4 words), evocative, and easily understood by the target audience. Avoid generic or overly literal names. Instead, aim to create a name that stands out, captures the essence of the product, and leaves a lasting impression.

**User Input Example:**

> Description: A noise-canceling, wireless, over-ear headphone with a 20-hour battery life and touch controls. Designed for audiophiles and frequent travelers.\

## Logo Design

The easiest way to create a logo is by leveraging the GPT that's seamlessly integrated with the ChatGPT+DallE AI image generation service, allowing for the entire design process to be completed effortlessly in one session. We recommend the <mark style="background-color:orange;">**Logo Creator**</mark> [<mark style="background-color:orange;">**https://chat.openai.com/g/g-gFt1ghYJl-logo-creator**</mark>](https://chat.openai.com/g/g-gFt1ghYJl-logo-creator), a top-rated GPT designed to methodically walk you through adjusting various elements of your logo, including its tone, color, and shape.&#x20;

**Example:**&#x20;

> Prompt: Generate a logo for an AI glass brand, the brand name is 'magic glass'

![](../.gitbook/assets/logo1.png)![](../.gitbook/assets/Logo2.png)![](../.gitbook/assets/logo3.png)

or you could use tools like stylar.ai to turn sketches into logo images.

At present, OpenAI's DallE does not quite match the brilliance of their GPT and Sora models. Therefore, for those seeking higher quality in logo design, turning to more robust image generation AI tools like **Midjourney** might yield more impressive results.
