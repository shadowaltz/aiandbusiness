Editor's note: For writing, the recommendation is to opt for larger, more comprehensively capable models. Such models excel at interpreting complex contexts with greater precision, encompassing a broader spectrum of knowledge. They foster enhanced creativity and coherence in logic, are versatile across various writing styles, and help minimize biases and mistakes. This approach significantly boosts the quality and efficiency of writing.

## Writing Assistant

Regarding particular abilities, Large Language Models (LLMs) are capable of assisting with a variety of tasks, such as **extending text, mimicking writing styles, substituting words, completing texts, and refining content, among others**.&#x20;

Example:

#### 1. **Extending Text**

* **Original Content**: "The rise of artificial intelligence has brought significant changes to various industries."
* **Prompt**: "Extend the following sentence: 'The rise of artificial intelligence has brought significant changes to various industries.'"
* **Result**: "The rise of artificial intelligence has brought significant changes to various industries, revolutionizing sectors like healthcare, finance, and education. In healthcare, AI systems enhance diagnostics and treatment accuracy, while in finance, they streamline risk assessment and fraud detection. Similarly, in education, AI-based tools are reshaping how students learn and interact with course materials."

#### 2. **Mimicking Writing Styles**

* **Original Content**: "The weather is sunny today, and it feels really nice outside."
* **Prompt**: "Rewrite the sentence 'The weather is sunny today, and it feels really nice outside' in an academic style."
* **Result (Academic Style)**: "Today’s atmospheric conditions are characterized by clear skies and abundant sunlight, contributing to a pleasant outdoor experience conducive to various activities."
* **Prompt**: "Rewrite the sentence 'The weather is sunny today, and it feels really nice outside' in a casual, conversational style."
* **Result (Casual Style)**: "Man, the weather is amazing today—sun’s out, and it’s the perfect day to chill outside!"

#### 3. **Substituting Words**

* **Original Content**: "The company is planning to expand its market presence."
* **Prompt**: "Substitute words in the sentence 'The company is planning to expand its market presence' with more formal or alternative words."
* **Result**: "The corporation intends to broaden its footprint in the market."

#### 4. **Completing Texts**

* **Original Content**: "Quantum computing holds the promise to revolutionize fields such as cryptography, by enabling…"
* **Prompt**: "Complete the sentence: 'Quantum computing holds the promise to revolutionize fields such as cryptography, by enabling…'"
* **Result**: "…the rapid decryption of complex codes, which would take traditional computers millions of years to crack. This advancement could not only disrupt cybersecurity but also offer breakthroughs in chemical modeling, drug discovery, and financial forecasting by performing calculations at speeds previously thought impossible."

#### 5. **Refining Content**

* **Original Content**: "The product is good and helps people do things more efficiently."
* **Prompt**: "Refine the sentence: 'The product is good and helps people do things more efficiently.'"
* **Result**: "The product significantly enhances productivity, enabling users to complete tasks with greater efficiency and precision."

#### 6. **Summarizing**

LLMs can generate concise summaries of longer texts, which is useful for quickly extracting key points from lengthy documents.

* **Original**: "The latest report from the World Economic Forum outlines how emerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence and blockchain, are poised to reshape global industries. The report highlights case studies from healthcare, finance, and supply chain sectors, demonstrating both the potential benefits and risks associated with these technologies."
* **Prompt**: "Summarize the following text: 'The latest report from the World Economic Forum outlines how emerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence and blockchain, are poised to reshape global industries...'"
* **Result**: "Emerging technologies like AI and blockchain are set to revolutionize industries, with examples from healthcare, finance, and supply chains showcasing both benefits and risks."

#### 7. **Generating Titles or Headlines**

LLMs can help craft catchy titles or headlines for articles, blogs, and other content.

* **Original**: "A detailed exploration of how artificial intelligence is impacting modern-day healthcare systems by improving diagnostics, treatment, and patient outcomes."
* **Prompt**: "Create a catchy headline for the following content: 'A detailed exploration of how artificial intelligence is impacting modern-day healthcare systems...'"
* **Result**: "AI in Healthcare: Revolutionizing Diagnostics and Patient Care"

#### 8. **Paraphrasing**

LLMs can rephrase a sentence or passage while maintaining the original meaning, which is useful for improving readability or avoiding repetition.

* **Original**: "Artificial intelligence is transforming industries worldwide, bringing both innovation and disruption."
* **Prompt**: "Paraphrase the following sentence: 'Artificial intelligence is transforming industries worldwide, bringing both innovation and disruption.'"
* **Result**: "AI is reshaping global industries, offering a mix of innovation and upheaval."

#### 9. **Correcting Grammar and Spelling**

* **Original**: "The impact of technology on businesses are enormous, as it helps improves efficency and productivity."
* **Prompt**: "Correct any grammar or spelling mistakes in the sentence: 'The impact of technology on businesses are enormous, as it helps improves efficency and productivity.'"
* **Result**: "The impact of technology on businesses is enormous, as it helps improve efficiency and productivity."

#### 10. **Converting Passive Voice to Active Voice (and vice versa)**

* **Original**: "The report was written by the committee."
* **Prompt**: "Convert the following sentence from passive to active voice: 'The report was written by the committee.'"
* **Result**: "The committee wrote the report."

#### 11. **Generating Ideas or Outlines**

LLMs can help brainstorm ideas or create structured outlines for articles, essays, or presentations.

* **Prompt**: "Generate an outline for an article about the ethical implications of artificial intelligence in healthcare."
* **Result**:
  1. Introduction
  2. Benefits of AI in healthcare
  3. Ethical concerns: Data privacy and patient consent
  4. Impact on jobs and decision-making in healthcare
  5. Case studies
  6. Conclusion

#### 12. **Expanding Bullet Points**

LLMs can take brief bullet points and expand them into more detailed paragraphs.

* **Original**:
  * AI in finance improves risk management.
  * Reduces fraud through anomaly detection.
* **Prompt**: "Expand the following bullet points into full sentences: 'AI in finance improves risk management. Reduces fraud through anomaly detection.'"
* **Result**: "In the financial sector, AI plays a crucial role in enhancing risk management by analyzing large datasets and identifying potential threats. Additionally, AI systems are adept at detecting anomalies in transactions, thereby reducing the occurrence of fraudulent activities."

### GPTs

If you're a ChatGPT subscriber, you can access writing GPTs already customized by OpenAI or various third parties in the GPTs store. A prime example is the top-ranked writing assistant in the catalog-

## <mark style="color:purple;">Create Your Own Writing GPTs</mark>

For those who frequently engage in writing, tailoring GPT models to your unique writing style is indispensable.&#x20;

Firstly, Press the 'Create' button located in the upper right corner of the GPTs Store page.

<img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Create GPT 1.png" alt="" data-size="original">

Next, during the customization process, click the Configure tab, give this GPT a **name**, write your Instructions (or just simply click on the 'Create' tab next to the Configure tab and allow the GPT to generate the name, logo, and instructions for you by chat), and ensure the GPT models are informed of your details, such as your age, preferred writing style, commonly used phrases, etc.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Create GPT 3.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Don't forget to gather articles or paragraphs that showcase your distinctive style. These can be in the form of .txt or .docx documents. Upload these documents as reference materials in the Knowledge section. Save, and you should be able to use this GPT for writing.&#x20;
