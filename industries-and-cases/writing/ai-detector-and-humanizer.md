#### “Copyright traps” could tell writers if an AI has scraped their work

{% hint style="info" %}
The accuracy of AI detectors is controversial, with significant differences between various models. These discrepancies primarily stem from the differing technologies and training data used by each platform. For instance, content that is entirely handwritten by humans might be incorrectly identified as being 100% AI-generated, while AI-generated content might sometimes evade detection altogether.

AI detector products which are developed and trained by the company itself, includes:

## <mark style="color:purple;">AI detector Aggregator</mark>

AI detection aggregators utilize multiple AI detector APIs to analyze the same piece of content simultaneously with different detectors, and then provide the results. For example:

## <mark style="color:purple;">Humanizer</mark>

{% hint style="warning" %}
Utilizing Humanizer can decrease the chances of AI-generated writing being identified, yet it does not offer 100% assurance against detection.
{% endhint %}

The **Humanizer**, designed to make AI-generated writing <mark style="color:red;">**appear more human-like and reduce detection as AI-produced**</mark>, enjoys widespread popularity.&#x20;

1. One straightforward strategy is incorporating instructions within the prompt that demand "_<mark style="color:red;">originality and human-like quality, making the content undetectable as AI-generated</mark>_". This approach has shown effectiveness, albeit with inconsistent results, and is limited by some large models' lack of internet connectivity to cross-reference the latest and online materials.&#x20;
2. Another prevalent tactic involves leveraging <mark style="background-color:orange;">**Humanizer**</mark> options available in ChatGPT's GPTs store, particularly within the Writing category. Notably, three of the top six GPTs in this category are Humanizers (as listed below), highlighting their strong demand. (Some of them have paid version for better performance now)

3. A third avenue is employing specialized **third-party services** designed to optimize content against prevalent AI detection tools in the market.
