### <mark style="color:orange;">Tesla FSD</mark>

Most other FSD systems use a combination of cameras, radars, and light detection and ranging (LIDAR) sensors to perceive the world around them but Tesla claims that its own system relies mostly on just cameras for perception and that driving decisions are made via a single neural network from start to finish. FSD is designed to work on any road without the need for pre-mapped data and is currently being roadtested using over 160,000 vehicles by customers globally in North America.
