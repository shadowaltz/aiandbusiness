On October 10, 2024, Tesla held its highly anticipated "We, Robot" event, CEO Elon Musk unveiled the company's latest autonomous vehicle, the Cybercab. This futuristic robotaxi, designed without a steering wheel or pedals, features butterfly doors and a compact interior that accommodates two passengers. Musk also introduced a larger autonomous vehicle called the Robovan, capable of transporting up to 20 people. Additionally, Tesla showcased advancements in its Full Self-Driving (FSD) technology, promising unsupervised autonomous driving capabilities for Model 3 and Model Y vehicles in Texas and California by 2025. The event also featured demonstrations of Tesla's Optimus humanoid robots, which Musk claimed could perform various tasks and might be available for $20,000â€“$30,000.
