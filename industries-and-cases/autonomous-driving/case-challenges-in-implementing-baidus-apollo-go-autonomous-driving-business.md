# Case: Challenges in Implementing Baidu's Apollo Go Autonomous Driving Business

Wuhan, China - Baidu's Apollo Go robotaxi service has ignited a fierce debate in Wuhan, with local taxi drivers protesting and residents raising concerns about safety and job security. The rapid expansion of the autonomous vehicle fleet has brought the challenges of integrating new technology into urban transportation to the forefront.

Apollo Go, operating over 500 robotaxis in Wuhan, has gained popularity due to its competitive pricing. Rides cost as little as 4 yuan (approximately $0.55), significantly undercutting traditional taxi fares of 18 yuan. This aggressive pricing strategy has led to widespread adoption but also to significant backlash.

Local taxi drivers have initiated strikes against Apollo Go, petitioning Wuhan's transport authority to restrict its operations. They argue that the robotaxis are "taking jobs from the grass roots" and causing a substantial decline in their income.

Safety concerns have also emerged, with residents lodging over 300 complaints on a government-run transport management website. The complaints allege that the robotaxis react too slowly to traffic lights. A recent minor collision between an Apollo Go vehicle and an electric scooter has further intensified these concerns.

The controversy has spilled over to social media, becoming a major topic of discussion on platforms like Weibo. Over 75 million users have expressed worries about potential job losses in related sectors such as driving schools, road inspection, and traditional taxi services.

The rapid integration of driverless taxis has unsettled China's gig economy workforce, already struggling with stagnant wages due to economic challenges. This has raised questions about the broader economic impact of autonomous vehicle technology.

Baidu has defended its service, citing high passenger satisfaction with an average rating of 4.9 out of 5 for service quality. The company has also reported cases of misinformation about Apollo Go to the police, resulting in arrests.

Despite the ongoing controversy, Baidu plans to expand its fleet to 1,000 vehicles by the end of 2024. This ambitious expansion plan underscores the company's commitment to autonomous vehicle technology, even in the face of public opposition.

The situation in Wuhan highlights the complex challenges associated with integrating autonomous vehicle technology into urban transportation systems. As cities worldwide grapple with similar issues, the Wuhan case serves as a crucial example of the need to balance technological innovation with job security and public safety concerns.

As the debate continues, it remains to be seen how local authorities will respond to the protests and concerns raised by various stakeholders. The outcome of this situation could have far-reaching implications for the future of autonomous vehicle deployment in urban areas across China and beyond.
