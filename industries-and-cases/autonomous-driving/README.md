<mark style="color:red;">**Autonomous driving**</mark> represents a significant domain within the commercial application of artificial intelligence, offering vast potential and value across the freight, logistics, and automotive sectors. This technology not only aims to elevate transport efficiency and slash costs but also plays a crucial role in diminishing traffic incidents, thereby boosting road safety.&#x20;

## Autonomous Car Brands:

### **US**

In the United States, Tesla's Full Self-Driving (FSD) initiative and Google's Waymo project stand out as two of the most prominent and dynamic developers in the autonomous driving landscape.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Tesla FSD" %}
One of the most well-known autonomous driving technology providers has opened its services to users across the U.S. for trials, receiving positive results and feedback. According to official news, Tesla is set to launch its robotaxi service soon.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Waymo" %}
Waymo, a subsidiary of Alphabet (Google's parent company), is one of the most prominent robotaxi operators in the US. They currently provide services in San Francisco, Phoenix, and Los Angeles, with plans to expand to Austin and Atlanta by 2025. Waymo has logged over 22 million autonomous miles as of June 2024 and recently released a report claiming their vehicles are safer than human drivers.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Cruise" %}
Formerly a major player, Cruise (backed by General Motors) faced setbacks in 2023 due to accidents in San Francisco. Their operations were suspended in California, leading to layoffs and a pause in their robotaxi services.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Zoox" %}
Amazon-owned Zoox is developing a unique robotaxi design that doesn't resemble traditional cars. Their vehicles feature inward-facing seats and doors that open on both sides. Zoox has been testing with employees and has logged over 700,000 autonomous miles in California and Las Vegas.
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}



### China

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Baidu Apollo" %}
Baidu's Apollo Go is a leading robotaxi service in China. In the first quarter of 2024, they provided about 826,000 rides, up 25% year over year. Apollo Go operates in multiple cities and aims to expand to 65 cities by 2025.

{% endtab %}

{% tab title="AutoX" %}
AutoX has launched robotaxi services in six major cities worldwide. In March 2023, they became Shanghai's first driverless robotaxi operator approved for downtown districts.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Pony.ai" %}
Pony.ai has partnered with Toyota and GAC to scale up production and deployment of Level 4 robotaxis in China. They plan to deploy a fleet of 1,000 bZ4X robotaxis in the first phase.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Didi Chuxing" %}
China's ride-hailing giant Didi is working on robotaxis through a joint venture with EV maker GAC Aion. They aim to produce electric SUV robotaxis and have a goal of reaching 1 million robotaxis by 2030.
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}



### Other Players

Several other companies are developing robotaxi technology, including traditional automakers like GM, Ford, and Volkswagen, as well as tech companies like Uber and Lyft, often through partnerships and investments.The robotaxi industry is rapidly evolving, with companies facing challenges in technology development, regulatory approval, and achieving profitability. While progress has been made, widespread adoption of robotaxis is still in its early stages.

## Legislative Developments <a href="#legislative-developments" id="legislative-developments"></a>

### United States <a href="#united-states" id="united-states"></a>

#### Federal Regulation

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has provided guidelines for the development and testing of autonomous vehicles, but these are not binding regulations.

#### State Laws

As of 2024, more than 30 states have enacted laws or executive orders related to autonomous vehicles. For example:

**California** allows testing and deployment of autonomous vehicles under strict conditions, including mandatory registration with the DMV and monthly reporting on disengagements and accidents. These regulations aim to promote safety while encouraging innovation in the autonomous vehicle space.

### European Union

The introduction of Regulation 2019/2144 on July 6, 2022, aims to significantly reduce fatalities on roads by mandating advanced safety technologies in vehicles. This regulation provides a legal framework for automated vehicles, enhancing the competitiveness of EU car manufacturers while addressing safety concerns.



### Japan

Japan has initiated changes with an amendment to its Road Traffic Act published on April 27, 2022, which introduces a permission system for Level 4 autonomous vehicles. This legislative shift illustrates Japan's commitment to integrating advanced vehicle technologies into its regulatory landscape.
