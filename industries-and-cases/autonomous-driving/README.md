# 🚗 Autonomous Driving

<mark style="color:red;">**Autonomous driving**</mark> represents a significant domain within the commercial application of artificial intelligence, offering vast potential and value across the freight, logistics, and automotive sectors. This technology not only aims to elevate transport efficiency and slash costs but also plays a crucial role in diminishing traffic incidents, thereby boosting road safety. In the United States, Tesla's Full Self-Driving (FSD) initiative and Google's Waymo project stand out as two of the most prominent and dynamic developers in the autonomous driving landscape.

<mark style="color:orange;">Tesla</mark> and <mark style="color:orange;">Waymo</mark> stand out as leading figures in autonomous vehicles, each adopting distinctly different approaches in developing and implementing their technology.

### Other **Autonomous driving Companies**

### <mark style="color:orange;">Wayve</mark>

Wayve, a British startup established in 2017, specializes in autonomous driving technology. The company leverages large generative models like GAIA-1 to create continuous video scenes for autonomous driving applications. Wayve has secured $1.05 billion in Series C funding led by SoftBank, with participation from NVIDIA and Microsoft, to advance its innovative embodied AI for autonomous driving. The funding will enable Wayve to develop and launch AI products that enhance vehicle autonomy and safety, transforming human interaction with machines.
