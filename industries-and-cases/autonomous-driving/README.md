# ðŸš— Autonomous Driving

<mark style="color:red;">**Autonomous driving**</mark> represents a significant domain within the commercial application of artificial intelligence, offering vast potential and value across the freight, logistics, and automotive sectors. This technology not only aims to elevate transport efficiency and slash costs but also plays a crucial role in diminishing traffic incidents, thereby boosting road safety. In the United States, Tesla's Full Self-Driving (FSD) initiative and Google's Waymo project stand out as two of the most prominent and dynamic developers in the autonomous driving landscape.

<mark style="color:orange;">Tesla</mark> and <mark style="color:orange;">Waymo</mark> stand out as leading figures in the field of autonomous vehicles, each adopting distinctly different approaches in the development and implementation of their technology.

In contrast, <mark style="color:orange;">Waymo</mark>'s approach uses a combination of cameras, radar, and lidar sensors, along with detailed pre-mapped data of specific operational areas. Waymo employs a series of interconnected neural networks trained separately for perception, behavior prediction, and planning. Waymo's vehicles are designed to be fully autonomous within their mapped areas and have been operating as a limited commercial driverless taxi service in Phoenix since 2020.



### <mark style="color:orange;">Wayve</mark>

Wayve, a British startup established in 2017, specializes in autonomous driving technology. The company focuses on leveraging large generative models like GAIA-1 to create continuous video scenes for autonomous driving applications. Wayve has secured $1.05 billion in Series C funding led by SoftBank, with participation from NVIDIA and Microsoft, to advance its innovative embodied AI for autonomous driving. The funding will enable Wayve to develop and launch AI products that enhance vehicle autonomy and safety, transforming human interaction with machines.
