# 💽 Coding

<details>

<summary>Vibe Coding</summary>

This is where coding meets flow. Vibe coding is more than just writing code—it’s an approach and a mindset. It’s about working in a creative state, turning programming into exploration and expression, making tech intuitive and fun.\
Put simply, **vibe coding is like writing down your ideas and letting the computer turn them into code—something anyone can do.**

<details>

<summary>Spec Coding</summary>

Spec Coding is the practice of "designing a flawless blueprint before building the house."

Instead of jumping straight into writing software, developers first create a precise mathematical description (the Specification) of exactly how the program must behave. By defining every rule and edge case in advance, they can prove the logic is perfect before a single line of actual code is written. It is essentially extreme planning used to ensure that critical systems—like those in airplanes or banks—are bug-free and fail-safe.
