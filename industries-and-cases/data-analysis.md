# 👩‍💻 Data Analysis

Data analysis stands as a fundamental pillar of modern commerce and plays a crucial role in the advancement of artificial intelligence. The rapid advancement of large language models (LLM) over the last two years has significantly eased the entry barrier into the data science domain, opening up a broader array of practical applications.

## Small to medium-scale datasets

For analyzing small to medium-scale datasets, simply copy and paste your data into the conversation interfaces of various Large Language Models (such as ChatGPT, Claude, etc.) and engage in a dialogue with the AI to obtain analysis results. Here are some examples of how to structure your **prompts:**&#x20;

You’ve been tasked with extracting valuable insights from a large dataset related to user behavior on a new app. Your goal is to provide actionable recommendations to improve user engagement and retention.

{% endhint %}

When dealing with larger datasets, such as databases exported from SQL or XLSX spreadsheets, the typical copy-and-paste method becomes impractical. Currently, most major LLM applications have introduced support for **uploading** various types of files, allowing us to upload data files into the dialogue box and then enter a prompt for analysis.&#x20;

Additionally, the **GPTs store** already offers a wide array of data analysis GPTs for use, accommodating uploads of various file formats like CSV, PDF, etc., to facilitate data analysis and data visualization tasks.

International football results from 1872 to 2024, contain an up-to-date dataset of over 45,000 international football results. Data retrieved from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/martj42/international-football-results-from-1872-to-2017?resource=download).

My question and prompt: "**How has the average number of goals scored per match changed over time? Break it down by decade starting from 1870. Please plot a histogram."**

Result:&#x20;
