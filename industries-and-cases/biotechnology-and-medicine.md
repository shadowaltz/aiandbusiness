### AlphaFold 3

[https://blog.google/technology/ai/google-deepmind-isomorphic-alphafold-3-ai-model/](https://blog.google/technology/ai/google-deepmind-isomorphic-alphafold-3-ai-model/)

AlphaFold 3, developed by Isomorphic Labs and Google DeepMind, predicts the structure and interactions of all life’s molecules with unprecedented accuracy. It models large biomolecules like proteins, DNA, and RNA, as well as small molecules (ligands), enabling insights into biological processes and accelerating drug discovery. The new AlphaFold Server, free for non-commercial research, allows scientists to use these capabilities. This model significantly improves upon previous methods, with potential applications in genomics, drug design, and more resilient crops.
