A lesser-known yet valuable web-based app. News Minimalist uses AI (ChatGPT-4) to read the top 1000 news every day and rank them by significance on a scale from 0 to 10. Significance is estimated based on seven factors:

> * **scale**: how many people the event affected;
> * **magnitude**: how big was the effect;
> * **potential**: how likely it is that the event will cause bigger events;
> * **novelty**: how unexpected or unique was the event;
> * **immediacy**: how close in time is the event;
> * **actionability**: how likely it is that a reader can act on the news for personal benefit;
> * **positivity**: how positive is the event — used to fix media negativity bias;
> * **credibility**: how credible is the source.
