At a time when ChatGPT was not able to access the internet, after all, and could be very inaccurate, in came Perplexity‚Äîan AI search engine application that primarily uses internet connectivity to source for whatever information it is. It guarantees sourcing for all the responses, thus leading to very high search speeds and a great user experience. With recent features like Copilot, it has become a serious competitor to Google and is now the default search engine for upcoming browsers like Arc.

Becoming more and more popular in the market, Perplexity has already formed alliances with many AI products such as Rabbit R1 or AI Frame. There is a free edition for those interested in checking out the features.

{% hint style="info" %}
AI search engines, exemplified by Perplexity, currently have an issue where the information sources they search are consistent with the language you use when asking the question. In simple terms, if you ask a question in English, it will default to searching for information in English on the internet; if you use German, it will search for German information; and if you ask in Chinese, it will search for Chinese information. Due to the significant differences in the richness of information among different languages and the possibility of varying perspectives on the same issue across different cultures, AI search engines might even arrive at opposite conclusions for the same question based on the language of the information. Please be aware of this.
