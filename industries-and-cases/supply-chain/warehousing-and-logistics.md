### Case: Home Depot Sidekick

The Home Depot, the world's largest home improvement specialty retailer, has introduced a new in-store application called Sidekick to enhance the customer experience and increase associate productivity. Developed in-house and powered by machine learning, Sidekick is designed to help store associates prioritize tasks more effectively by guiding them to focus on high-demand products, identifying which shelves need restocking, and locating excess inventory on overhead shelves. The app leverages cloud-enabled algorithms and machine vision technology to determine actionable tasks, detect out-of-stock items, and alert specific associates about priority assignments through a common tasking engine. Sidekick integrates seamlessly with Home Depot's existing systems and has already been installed in over 600 stores, with plans to expand to all U.S. locations by the end of the 2022 fiscal year.
