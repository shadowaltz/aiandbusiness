# Manufacturing & Production

### Case: Bosch

Bosch is revolutionizing manufacturing quality control by using generative AI to create synthetic images of defective parts. This innovative approach addresses the challenge of obtaining enough real images of faulty components, especially for new product lines. At their Hildesheim plant, Bosch implemented this technology to inspect stators, crucial components in electric motors. The AI-based system, trained on both real and artificially generated images, can detect defects with nearly 100% accuracy, significantly outperforming human inspectors. This method has reduced project duration by six months and is expected to increase annual productivity by hundreds of thousands of euros1. Bosch plans to expand this technology to other plants globally, as it represents a major advancement in improving manufacturing efficiency and quality.
