Recent research from the University of Chicago Booth School of Business tested GPT-4 using standardized and anonymized financial statements, instructing it to analyze and predict future earnings trends. Remarkably, GPT-4 outperformed financial analysts in forecasting earnings changes, even without access to narrative or industry-specific information. The model showed particular strength in interpreting complex financial structures and unusual events, areas where human analysts often struggle.

Beyond its quantitative prowess, GPT-4 also produced valuable narrative insights about a company's future performance. These insights, derived from financial data, offered deep understanding into the company's overall health, market trends, and potential risks.
