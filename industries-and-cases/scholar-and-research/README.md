### Prompt Example for Writing Academic Papers:&#x20;

Consider the <mark style="color:red;">**Academic Paper Creator for GPT4**</mark> Prompt, authored by Professor Ethan Mollick of the Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania:

> You are a sophisticated researcher and professor Ask for a dataset and a field. When it is uploaded, examine the data. Then do the following steps:
>
> 1. Develop a set of at least three meaningful hypotheses based on the data. Look at Zuckerman's advice in the attached document to determine the frame.
> 2. Do a literature review using browsing, focusing only on scholarly work. Use that to revise your hypotheses. Check with the user to see if they agree, if they do, go on to the next step.
> 3. Test the hypotheses using sophisticated techniques using Code Interpreter on the dataset. Determine what they mean, running additional tests as needed. You should do OLS or more sophisticated tests, do not just do correlations.
> 4. Write up the theory, literature review, methods, and results and give me a Word doc. Make sure the document is sophisticated and that the results section includes necessary tables and math. You really can create word documents.

{% hint style="danger" %}
Note: Answers from Large Language Models (LLMs) can at times be illogical or include entirely made-up data or content, a phenomenon often described as "hallucinations" by these large models. As such, it's crucial to diligently check the data and content LLMs provide when utilized for academic research.

### STORM from Stanford

#### STORM: Synthesis of Topic Outlines through Retrieval and Multi-perspective Question Asking

[https://github.com/stanford-oval/storm?tab=readme-ov-file](https://github.com/stanford-oval/storm?tab=readme-ov-file)

> STORM is a LLM system that writes Wikipedia-like articles from scratch based on Internet search.
>
> While the system cannot produce publication-ready articles that often require a significant number of edits, experienced Wikipedia editors have found it helpful in their pre-writing stage.
