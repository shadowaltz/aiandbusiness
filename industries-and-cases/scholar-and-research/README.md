#### STORM: Synthesis of Topic Outlines through Retrieval and Multi-perspective Question Asking

[storm-project.stanford.edu](https://storm-project.stanford.edu/)

> STORM is a LLM system that writes Wikipedia-like articles from scratch based on Internet search.
>
> While the system cannot produce publication-ready articles that often require a significant number of edits, experienced Wikipedia editors have found it helpful in their pre-writing stage.

> Towards Fully Automated Open-Ended Scientific Discovery

The AI Scientist project is designed to automate the entire scientific research process. It is equipped to handle a variety of tasks, from generating research ideas and reviewing literature to planning, executing experiments, and writing research papers. By leveraging this system, AI can manage iterative experimental workflows, create visual data representations, and produce scientific reports that resemble those presented at typical machine learning conferences.

The AI Scientist is composed of four key stages: brainstorming research ideas, conducting experiments to gather data, drafting research papers using LaTeX, and performing peer reviews through an automated system. This system incorporates cutting-edge large language model (LLM) technology to effectively replicate the scientific activities typically performed by humans.
