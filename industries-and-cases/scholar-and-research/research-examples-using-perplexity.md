{% hint style="success" %}
Here is an example of how to use perplexity to summarize and refine an important academic/business report. &#x20;
{% endhint %}

**Research Paper used:** Stanford HAI annual report

**Perplexity Model used:** GPT-4o

**Prompt I use:** what are the key findings from the Stanford hai 2024 AI index report？ Please list in tabular form

**Perplexity:**

The key findings from the Stanford HAI 2024 AI Index Report can be summarized in the following table:

<table data-header-hidden><thead><tr><th width="206"></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Key Finding</strong></td><td><strong>Description</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Human vs. AI Performance</strong></td><td>AI has excelled beyond human capabilities in several domains such as image classification and language understanding, but remains less adept at complex tasks like advanced mathematics and visual commonsense reasoning[1][4].</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Dominance of Industry in AI Research</strong></td><td>Industry continues to lead in AI innovation, producing 51 significant machine learning models in 2023 compared to academia’s 15. Collaborative efforts between industry and academia resulted in 21 notable models[1][4].</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Surging Costs of AI Development</strong></td><td>The financial investment required to train state-of-the-art AI models has soared, with OpenAI’s GPT-4 and Google’s Gemini Ultra requiring an estimated $78 million and $191 million respectively in compute costs[1][2][4].</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Geographical AI Leadership</strong></td><td>The United States remains a leader in AI development, significantly outpacing other regions with 61 notable AI models developed in 2023. The U.S. also leads in AI investment, with $67.2 billion privately invested in 2023[1][2][4].</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Lack of Standardization in AI Evaluation</strong></td><td>There is a notable absence of standardized evaluations for large language models (LLMs), complicating the comparison of risks and limitations across different AI systems[1][4].</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Booming Generative AI Investment</strong></td><td>Despite a general dip in AI investments, funding for generative AI technologies surged to $25.2 billion in 2023, nearly eight times the amount from the previous year[1][4].</td></tr><tr><td><strong>AI’s Impact on Workforce Productivity</strong></td><td>Studies in 2023 suggest that AI can enhance worker productivity and quality of output, though there are warnings about potential declines in performance without proper oversight[1][4].</td></tr><tr><td><strong>AI in Scientific Advancement</strong></td><td>AI’s contribution to scientific discovery has accelerated, with new applications in 2023 enhancing processes from algorithmic sorting to materials discovery[1][4].</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Rise in AI Regulations</strong></td><td>The U.S. saw a significant increase in AI-related regulations, with 25 new regulations introduced in 2023, marking a sharp rise over the past five years[1][3][4].</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Public Perception and Concerns</strong></td><td>Global awareness and apprehension about AI’s impact are growing, with more people expressing nervousness about AI technologies and their potential effects on daily life[1][4].</td></tr></tbody></table>

These findings highlight the rapid advancements and growing influence of AI, as well as the challenges and concerns associated with its development and deployment.
