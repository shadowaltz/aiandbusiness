## The Inspiration Behind This Website

I registered the domain aiandbusiness.com in 2018. For the first few years, I was unsure how best to use it. The surge of generative AI in 2022 opened my eyes to limitless possibilities. From large language models to image and video generation, AI technology has been advancing at a breathtaking pace. This rapid development has given rise to a plethora of AI applications. However, the sheer number and variety of these applications make it hard for the general public to fully understand them. Business professionals looking to utilize AI tools often struggle to choose the right ones. While writing my book, I gathered a significant amount of information and created a knowledge base on Notion in 2023. This inspired me to enhance the knowledge base into a comprehensive website that offers educational content, case studies, and tools, and to share it with everyone.
