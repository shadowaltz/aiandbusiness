### Claude Skills

_Claude Skills_ are a new modular feature in Anthropic’s Claude AI that lets Claude dynamically load folders of instructions, scripts, and resources to handle specialized tasks more consistently and efficiently—such as generating formatted documents, applying brand‑specific styles, analyzing data, or running custom workflows—by teaching the model how to perform these tasks in a repeatable way without needing long, repeated prompts.

> A skill is a directory containing a SKILL.md file that contains organized folders of instructions, scripts, and resources that give agents additional capabilities.
