# Case: Meta Glasses

In a video demonstration, the students from Havard showcased how their modified Meta AI glasses could identify classmates in real time, revealing their addresses and names of family members. The system works by live streaming video from the glasses to Instagram, where a computer program monitors the stream and uses AI to detect faces. These faces are then matched against online databases to retrieve personal details such as names, phone numbers, addresses, and even social security numbers.
