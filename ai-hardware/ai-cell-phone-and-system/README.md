Apple released a new model called Ferret UI tailored for comprehending and interacting with mobile user interfaces (UIs). Ferret-UI enhances Ferret by integrating "any resolution" support to handle the elongated aspect ratios and small UI elements typical of mobile screens. It can perform tasks such as icon recognition, text finding, and widget listing. The model was trained on a comprehensive dataset and benchmarked against other UI understanding models, demonstrating superior performance in elementary and advanced UI tasks.
