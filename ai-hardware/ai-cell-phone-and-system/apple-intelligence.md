# Apple Intelligence

Apple has recently introduced "Apple Intelligence," a comprehensive suite of generative AI features designed to enhance user experience across iPhone, iPad, and Mac devices. This new system is deeply integrated into iOS 18, iPadOS 18, and macOS Sequoia, leveraging the power of Apple silicon to understand and create language and images, take action across apps, and draw from personal context to simplify and accelerate everyday tasks.

### Key Features of Apple Intelligence

1. **Privacy and Security**:
   * **On-Device Processing**: Many AI models run entirely on the device, ensuring that personal data remains private.
   * **Private Cloud Compute**: For more complex tasks, Apple Intelligence can utilize server-based models while maintaining privacy through cryptographic measures and independent code inspections.
2. **Generative AI Capabilities**:
   * **Writing Tools**: These tools help users rewrite, proofread, and summarize text across various apps, including Mail, Notes, and Pages. Features like "Rewrite" allow users to adjust the tone of their writing, while "Proofread" checks grammar and suggests edits.
   * **Image Creation**: The "Image Playground" feature enables users to create images in styles like Animation, Illustration, or Sketch. Users can also generate images based on descriptions and integrate them into apps like Messages and Notes.
3. **Integration with ChatGPT**:
   * **Siri and Writing Tools**: Siri can now access ChatGPT for expertise and image/document understanding. Users are prompted before any data is shared with ChatGPT, ensuring privacy. ChatGPT is also integrated into systemwide Writing Tools for content generation.
4. **Enhanced Siri Capabilities**:
   * **Contextual Understanding**: Siri can now understand and act on content within apps, maintain context across requests, and provide more natural and relevant responses. Users can also type to Siri and switch between text and voice communication.
5. **Photos and Videos**:
   * **Advanced Search**: Users can search for specific photos and moments in videos using natural language. The new "Clean Up" tool can remove distracting objects from photos without altering the main subject.
   * **Memories**: Users can create custom memory movies by typing descriptions, with Apple Intelligence selecting the best photos and videos to craft a narrative.
6. **Notifications and Email Management**:
   * **Priority Notifications**: Important notifications are surfaced at the top of the stack, and summaries help users scan long notifications quickly.
   * **Mail Enhancements**: Features like "Priority Messages" and "Smart Reply" help users manage their inbox more efficiently.

### Availability

Apple Intelligence will be available in beta as part of iOS 18, iPadOS 18, and macOS Sequoia this fall, initially in U.S. English. It will be accessible on iPhone 15 Pro, iPhone 15 Pro Max, and iPad and Mac devices with M1 and later.
