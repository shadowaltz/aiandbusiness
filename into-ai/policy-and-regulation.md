* Restrictions on the use of biometric identification systems by law enforcement
* A ban on social scoring and AI that exploits users' vulnerabilities
* Granting consumers the right to lodge complaints and receive meaningful explanations

The act prohibits certain AI applications that pose a threat to citizens' rights and imposes obligations based on the potential risk and impact of AI. The legislation was approved with 523 votes in favor, 46 against, and 49 abstentions. Lawmakers assert that this act will reduce risks, create opportunities, combat discrimination, and enhance transparency while safeguarding workers' and citizens' rights.
