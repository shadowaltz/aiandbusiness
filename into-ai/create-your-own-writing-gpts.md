Next, during the customization process, click the Configure tab, give this GPT a **name**, write your Instructions (or just simply click on the 'Create' tab next to the Configure tab and allow the GPT to generate the name, logo, and instructions for you by chat), and ensure the GPT models are informed of your details, such as your age, preferred writing style, commonly used phrases, etc.&#x20;
