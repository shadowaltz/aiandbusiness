# ChatGPT Agent

A ChatGPT Agent is an AI-powered assistant built on OpenAI technology that works like a “digital employee.” It can understand natural language, call tools, access APIs, organize data, create content, and even automate workflows. Unlike one-off chats, an Agent has memory, goals, and the ability to work continuously, making it useful for customer service, data analysis, content creation, and business process automation.
