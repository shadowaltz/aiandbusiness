# ðŸ‘¾ AI Agents

{% hint style="info" %}
AI Agents are still in their early stages, and building one requires some basic programming knowledge.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

## **Automation Platforms**:&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
These are considered automation platforms strictly speaking. However, with the recent integration of LLM, they now function similarly to an AI Agent. Their ease of deployment and use, along with wide support for various online platforms, have attracted many users, significantly enhancing business processes. Thatâ€™s why theyâ€™re included here.

{% embed url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pl_wJQ8JA5M&t=4s&ab_channel=MultiOn" %}

**Advanced Reasoning Capabilities:**\
Agent Q combines several innovative techniques to enhance its decision-making and problem-solving abilities:

* Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS): This allows Agent Q to explore different paths on websites, similar to how a GPS system considers multiple routes.
* Self-Critique Mechanism: The AI evaluates its own actions and learns from its mistakes, enabling continuous improvement.
* Direct Preference Optimization (DPO): Agent Q learns which actions are more effective based on successful and unsuccessful attempts, mimicking human learning through trial and error.

**Impressive Performance:**\
In real-world testing, Agent Q has demonstrated remarkable capabilities:

* It achieved a 95.4% success rate on real-world booking tasks, representing a 340% improvement over the baseline zero-shot performance of Llama 3.
* Agent Q outperforms existing models and even surpasses average human performance on certain web navigation tasks.

### Applications and Implications

Agent Q's advanced capabilities make it particularly well-suited for complex, multi-step tasks in dynamic environments like the web5. This technology could revolutionize areas such as:

* Travel planning and booking
* E-commerce interactions
* Customer service automation
* Research and information gathering
