<summary>What is an AI Agent?</summary>

An AI Agent is a computer program or system that can perceive its environment, make decisions, and take actions. These agents have autonomy, are goal-oriented, can learn, and use logical reasoning. They understand user intentions through inputs and can autonomously plan and execute complex tasks.

<summary>Why is an AI Agent important?</summary>

Modern AI Agents are built on the capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Once developed, they will surpass ordinary LLMs in functionality, accomplishing tasks that LLMs cannot. The cases we discussed in the previous section were aimed at providing ideas for constructing AI Agents.
