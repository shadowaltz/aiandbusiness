# ðŸ‘¾ AI Agents

AI Agents are still in their early stages, and building one requires some basic programming knowledge.&#x20;

## **Automation Platforms**:&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
These are considered automation platforms strictly speaking. However, with the recent integration of LLM, they now function similarly to an AI Agent. Their ease of deployment and use, along with wide support for various online platforms, have attracted many users, significantly enhancing business processes. Thatâ€™s why theyâ€™re included here.

**What makes n8n AI Agent better or different from competitors:**

* Unlike closed platforms (e.g., Zapier, Make.com), n8n offers ultimate flexibility through open-source code, self-hosting, and deep customization, ensuring youâ€™re not locked into a vendor or pricing model
* Its AI Agent node acts as a true decision-maker, orchestrating multi-step, context-aware workflows that go beyond static prompts or simple API callsâ€”something most other automation tools struggle to offer natively

Part 2

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Crew AI" %}
CrewAI is a fast, open-source Python framework that enables developers to build collaborative teams of autonomous AI agentsâ€”each with specialized roles and toolsâ€”to automate complex, structured workflows, standing out from competitors by offering deep customization, model-agnostic integration, and a modular, role-based architecture that excels in enterprise and multi-agent scenarios.

**What sets CrewAI apart:**

* Unlike many frameworks focused on single-agent or open-ended problem-solving, CrewAI specializes in structured, team-based automation where agents collaborate as a coordinated unitâ€”ideal for known, repeatable business processes.
* Its modular, role-based architecture and flexible agent orchestration allow for granular control over workflows, agent interactions, and integration with diverse AI models and external tools.
* CrewAIâ€™s open-source nature and broad LLM compatibility provide greater transparency, extensibility, and future-proofing compared to more closed or single-model frameworks.
