# Case: Altera Project Sid



[https://altera.al/](https://altera.al/)

Altera AI's Project Sid is like a giant virtual experiment where over 1,000 artificial intelligence (AI) characters work together in a Minecraft world. These AI characters, called agents, can think and act on their own without humans telling them what to do. They can play Minecraft for hours or even days, building things, trading items, and even creating their own society. The AI agents have developed their own economy using gems as money, formed religions, and even set up a basic government where they vote on rules. It's as if a whole civilization of robots is living inside the game, figuring out how to work together and solve problems. Scientists are using Project Sid to learn more about how AI can cooperate and create complex societies, which could help them develop smarter and more helpful AI in the future.
