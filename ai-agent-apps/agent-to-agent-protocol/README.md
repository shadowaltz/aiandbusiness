### **Whatâ€™s the difference between MCP and A2A?**

MCP (Model Context Protocol) and A2A (Agent-to-Agent Protocol) serve different purposes and work in distinct ways.

***

ðŸ§© **MCP (Model Context Protocol)**\
â€¢ **Purpose**: Enables a single AI model to interact with external tools and data sources\
â€¢ **How it works**: Uses precise, structured _function calls_ to connect with APIs and tools\
â€¢ **Best for**: Predictable, well-defined tasks like data retrieval, calculations, or search

***

ðŸ¤– **A2A (Agent-to-Agent Protocol)**\
â€¢ **Purpose**: Allows multiple AI agents to collaborate asynchronously by sharing tasks and outputs\
â€¢ **How it works**: Supports flexible task delegation and coordination in multi-agent environments\
â€¢ **Best for**: Complex workflows where autonomous agents need to solve problems together

***

âœ… **Summary**\
â€¢ **MCP**: Enhances individual agent capabilities\
â€¢ **A2A**: Enables collaboration between multiple agents
