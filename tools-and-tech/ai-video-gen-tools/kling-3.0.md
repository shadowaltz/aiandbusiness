# Kling 3.0

### 1. Executive Summary

Kling AI 3.0 represents a structural shift in generative video, moving from simple "clip generation" to a "Director-Centric" ecosystem. With the introduction of the Canvas Agent, Kling AI provides a unified workspace for managing multi-shot narratives, significantly reducing the randomness typically associated with AI video tools.

### 2. Key Features and Capabilities

#### 2.1 Video Generation (The Omni Engine)

* Extended Duration: Supports native generation of up to 15 seconds of high-coherence video, currently an industry-leading standard.
* 4K Ultra HD: Native support for 4K output, delivering professional-grade detail suitable for commercial advertising and film production.
* Physics & Consistency: Powered by Subject Consistency 2.0, the model ensures that character traits, clothing, and environmental lighting remain identical across multiple camera angles.

#### 2.2 Kling IMAGE 3.0

The image model has been upgraded to support professional design workflows:

* Image Series: Generate a sequence of connected frames to create high-fidelity storyboards.
* Multi-Reference Fusion: Allows users to combine Character References (cref) and Style References (sref) within a single generation pass.

#### 2.3 Canvas Agent (New Workspace)

The Canvas Agent is a dedicated environment for "Iterative Narrative Editing":

* Storyboard Management: Organize and preview multiple shots in a single interface to ensure narrative flow.
* Natural Language Direction: Users can request specific camera movements (e.g., "Add a 3-second zoom-in shot of the object") directly within the agent.
* Visual Logic Sync: Automatically analyzes previous shots to ensure visual logic remains consistent in subsequent generations.
