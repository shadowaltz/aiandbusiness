# 🪪 AI Agent Tools

### 1. Top Developer Frameworks

{% hint style="success" %}
These frameworks define the reasoning logic and multi-agent collaboration patterns—the "skeleton" of any AI Agent.
{% endhint %}

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="LangGraph" %}
Currently the industry standard for building complex, stateful agents. It allows developers to define agent logic as a "graph," enabling loops and error-correction cycles that traditional linear chains cannot handle.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="CrewAI" %}
A framework focused on "Role-Playing" collaboration. You can define specialized agents (e.g., Researcher, Writer, Editor) and let them work as a team to complete structured workflows like content creation or market analysis.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Microsoft AutoGen" %}
A pioneering framework for multi-agent conversations, supporting highly customizable patterns for complex human-machine and agent-to-agent interactions.

### 2. Connectivity & Protocols

{% hint style="success" %}
These solve the problem of how agents access external data and tools securely and efficiently.
{% endhint %}

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Anthropic MCP (Model Context Protocol)" %}
A milestone open standard introduced by Anthropic. MCP eliminates "data silos" by allowing developers to build an MCP Server once. Any compatible AI model (Claude, GPT, etc.) can then instantly access local files, databases, or tools (Slack, GitHub) without custom integration code.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Google A2A" %}

{% endtab %}

{% tab title="LlamaIndex" %}
