## <mark style="color:blue;">What's New?</mark>

### &#x20;Codex app

OpenAI’s Codex app is a new macOS productivity and developer tool that unifies the company’s cloud‑based software engineering AI agent into a dedicated desktop interface where multiple autonomous coding agents can run in parallel, manage worktrees, automate tasks, integrate with Git, use “Skills,” and help build, review, and ship software more efficiently from natural‑language prompts or structured workflows — essentially turning AI into a multitasking virtual engineering teammate right on your Mac.

### OpenClaw(Clawdbot/Moltbot)

OpenClaw is an open‑source, self‑hosted autonomous AI agent platform (originally released as _Clawdbot_ and later _Moltbot_) that runs on your own machine and connects to familiar messaging apps like WhatsApp, Telegram, Discord, Slack, Signal, and iMessage to act as a proactive digital assistant that not only chats but executes real‑world tasks (e.g., managing messages, calendars, emails, workflows, and scripts) based on your permissions and integrations.

### Figure Helix 02

Figure AI’s Helix 02 — launched as the next generation of its humanoid AI control system — is a unified neural architecture that gives a Figure humanoid robot full‑body autonomy, enabling it to walk, balance, perceive, and manipulate objects continuously across complex, long‑horizon tasks (like unloading and reloading a dishwasher) entirely from onboard sensors with no human intervention. It represents a major stride in _loco‑manipulation_ by integrating perception and whole‑body control into one learned system that reasons from pixels to joint torques.

### Moltbot(Clawdbot)

Moltbot (formerly known as Clawdbot) is a viral open‑source personal AI agent that “actually does things” by running locally on your own hardware and autonomously managing tasks like clearing your inbox, sending emails, automating scripts, handling calendars, and interacting through messaging apps such as WhatsApp, Telegram, Discord, or iMessage — blending real task execution with persistent memory and user‑chosen AI models rather than just generating chat replies.

### Claude Cowork

Anthropic’s Claude Cowork is a new feature in the Claude Desktop app that lets the AI act like a proactive digital coworker—automatically reading, editing, organizing, and creating files in a designated folder to complete non‑coding productivity tasks without needing you to write code, effectively bringing the power of Claude Code to everyday work workflows.

### ChatGPT Health

{% hint style="success" %}
_ChatGPT Health_ is a new dedicated health and wellness experience within ChatGPT launched by OpenAI that lets users securely connect their medical records and wellness apps (like Apple Health or MyFitnessPal), provides a separate tab with enhanced privacy and data isolation for health‑related conversations, and helps people understand lab results, prepare for doctor visits, track wellness patterns, and explore insurance options—while clearly positioning itself as a supportive informational tool (not a replacement for professional medical care).
{% endhint %}

### NVIDIA Rubin

{% hint style="success" %}
**TL;DR:** _NVIDIA Rubin_ is NVIDIA’s upcoming 2026 AI GPU architecture, succeeding Blackwell, and forms the core of the Vera Rubin platform—a next-gen AI computing system optimized for ultra‑high throughput, larger context windows, and efficient AI model training and inference with HBM4 memory, designed to power future data centers at scale.

### NVIDIA DRIVE Alpamayo‑R1

{% hint style="success" %}
**TL;DR:** NVIDIA DRIVE Alpamayo‑R1, an open‑source reasoning vision‑language‑action (VLA) AI model designed specifically for autonomous driving research and development that integrates vision, language, and action planning—allowing vehicles to interpret sensor inputs, reason through complex scenarios (chain‑of‑causation), plan safe trajectories, and even explain decisions, advancing the path toward safer Level 4 autonomy. Already partnered with Mercedes-Benz, with plans to deploy it on the next-gen CLA as early as next year.
{% endhint %}

### Boston Dynamics Atlas

{% hint style="success" %}
**TL;DR:** Boston Dynamics just revealed the **product version of Atlas** — an **enterprise-grade humanoid robot built for real industrial use**.\
Fully electric, capable of lifting **\~50 kg (110 lbs)**, with **56 degrees of freedom**, autonomous navigation, automatic battery swapping, and a clear roadmap toward factory deployment and large-scale production.
{% endhint %}

### Claude Skills

{% hint style="success" %}
**TL;DR:** _Claude Skills_ are a new modular feature in Anthropic’s Claude AI that lets Claude dynamically load folders of instructions, scripts, and resources to handle specialized tasks more consistently and efficiently—such as generating formatted documents, applying brand‑specific styles, analyzing data, or running custom workflows—by teaching the model how to perform these tasks in a repeatable way without needing long, repeated prompts.

> A skill is a directory containing a SKILL.md file that contains organized folders of instructions, scripts, and resources that give agents additional capabilities.

### Agentic AI Foundation

{% hint style="success" %}
**TL;DR:** _The Agentic AI Foundation (AAIF)_ is a newly established open‑source, neutral governance foundation under the Linux Foundation co‑founded by OpenAI, Anthropic, Block and backed by major tech companies like Google, Microsoft, AWS, Bloomberg, and Cloudflare to standardize, steward, and advance agentic AI technologies—providing interoperable open standards and protocols (such as OpenAI’s AGENTS.md, Anthropic’s Model Context Protocol, and Block’s Goose framework) so developers and organizations can build autonomous, action‑oriented AI systems collaboratively and transparently.
