### Figure Helix 02

{% hint style="success" %}
**TL;DR:** Figure AI’s Helix 02 — launched as the next generation of its humanoid AI control system — is a unified neural architecture that gives a Figure humanoid robot full‑body autonomy, enabling it to walk, balance, perceive, and manipulate objects continuously across complex, long‑horizon tasks (like unloading and reloading a dishwasher) entirely from onboard sensors with no human intervention. It represents a major stride in _loco‑manipulation_ by integrating perception and whole‑body control into one learned system that reasons from pixels to joint torques.
