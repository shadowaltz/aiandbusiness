## How to create Manga using AIÔºü

### 1. Do it manually

The first step, use an LLM such as ChatGPT/Claude to create the necessary components for your comics, including the story, scripts, storyboards, etc.

Then, select a text-to-image tool that suits your needs

We will use Midjourney here, known for its high-quality and consistent outputs. Notably, it includes NIJI Journey, a feature specifically tailored for anime and comic creation, making it an excellent choice for comic generation. Furthermore, its recent updates have significantly improved character consistency, effectively addressing the previously challenging problem of maintaining continuity in characters generated by the tool.

In the last step, simply position each image within a drawing or comic editing app as desired.&#x20;

### 2. AI Comic Apps

A more straightforward approach would be to utilize AI applications specifically tailored for comic creation.
