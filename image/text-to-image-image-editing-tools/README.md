{% tab title="Flux. 1" %}
{% hint style="success" %}
**Flux 1**, created by the original members of Stable Diffusion, has now fully surpassed the performance of Stable Diffusion. It is fully compatible with mainstream UIs like Comfy UI and has become the most powerful open-source text-to-image model, even slightly surpassing Midjourney in some aspects. This has significantly enhanced the capabilities of various SaaS businesses based on Stable Diffusion.

Stable Diffusion, an open-source model for generating images from text, has significantly impacted the field of AI-powered image creation. Its standout features include the ability to produce high-quality, lifelike images consistently and the flexibility of being open-source and customizable. This allows users to run it on personal computers, tailor it with their datasets, and apply it across various domains like product design and virtual environment crafting, streamlining creative workflows.&#x20;

Despite its high-quality outputs and versatility, Stable Diffusion's complexity, the need for robust hardware, and substantial storage requirements for data make it both a powerful and demanding tool. It offers great potential for those who can navigate its higher operational demands.

{% hint style="info" %}
Due to the recent mass departure of the executives and core team at Stable Diffusion (Stability AI), the outlook for future developments in applications that generate images and videos using this technology remains uncertain.
