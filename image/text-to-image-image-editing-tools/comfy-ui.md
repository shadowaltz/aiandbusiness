# Comfy UI

{% hint style="success" %}
ComfyUI is a powerful and flexible node-based interface for Stable Diffusion, allowing users to create complex AI image generation workflows without coding. It was developed as an alternative to other Stable Diffusion GUIs, offering more granular control over the image generation process and enabling users to experiment with advanced techniques through its modular, visual approach.
