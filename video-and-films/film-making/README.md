In February 2024, OpenAI introduced <mark style="color:orange;">**Sora**</mark>**.** It stands out as the most impressive application for generating videos from text. Sora harnesses a diffusion model, operating on the same Transformer architecture that powers ChatGPT. Beginning with videos infused with random noise, it meticulously refines these through several stages, eliminating noise to create videos that are both clear and fluid. This innovative approach to video creation promises enhanced quality and a more authentic viewing experience.&#x20;
