Captions is a video editing app that allows users to correct eye contact in post-production. Users can upload a video, apply an eye contact correction with a single click, and then download the edited video for use. This feature ensures that even if the original recording did not capture perfect eye contact, it can be adjusted afterward to create a more engaging and professional-looking video.
