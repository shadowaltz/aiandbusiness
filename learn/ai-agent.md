# AI Agent

<details>

<summary>What is an AI Agent?</summary>

An AI Agent is a computer program or system that can perceive its environment, make decisions, and take actions. These agents have autonomy, are goal-oriented, can learn, and use logical reasoning. They understand user intentions through inputs and can autonomously plan and execute complex tasks.

<summary>Why is an AI Agent important?</summary>

Modern AI Agents are built on the capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Once developed, they will surpass ordinary LLMs in functionality, accomplishing tasks that LLMs cannot. The cases we discussed in the previous section were aimed at providing ideas for constructing AI Agents.

<summary>Agentic AI Foundation (OpenAI)</summary>

_The Agentic AI Foundation (AAIF)_ is a newly established open‑source, neutral governance foundation under the Linux Foundation co‑founded by OpenAI, Anthropic, Block and backed by major tech companies like Google, Microsoft, AWS, Bloomberg, and Cloudflare to standardize, steward, and advance agentic AI technologies—providing interoperable open standards and protocols (such as OpenAI’s AGENTS.md, Anthropic’s Model Context Protocol, and Block’s Goose framework) so developers and organizations can build autonomous, action‑oriented AI systems collaboratively and transparently.
